h1. XNYandexInflector.framework 

XNYandexInflector is a very simple framework which provides an objective-c wrapper for Yandex.Inflect service. 

Original yandex.inflect is here: http://nano.yandex.ru/project/inflect/

h2. How to use

First you'll need to add the framework to your XCode project, than do 

<pre><code>
#import <XNYandexInflector/XNYandexInflector.h>
</code></pre>

After that, you can use Inflector via it's sharedInflector class method: 

<pre><code>
NSString *inflected = [[Inflector sharedInflector] inflectString: @"Вася Пупкин"].prepositional;
</code></pre>

That would return "Васе Пупкине".

h2. Todo

I think it's too slow to use it in a real project. 
I'll take a look on what can be simplified and optimized. 

And what definitely should be in the framework is a caching mechanism.
